* Emacs Spotify Plus

Spotify Plus allows you to control Spotify from within Emacs.
Although other Spotify plugins exist, this is the only one to use the PKCE OAuth2 flow, which provides much more security and is built for plugins like these.

For now, this plugin allows you to play the next/previous song, and play/pause on the current device. However, it may soon have features such as displaying, modifying, and searching for data in buffers.

** Getting Started

*** Logging in to Spotify

- Login to Spotify with =M-x spotify+-start <RET>=.

*** Controlling Spotify

- Play the current song with =M-x spotify+-play <RET>=.
- Pause the current song with =M-x spotify+-pause <RET>=.
- Play the next song with =M-x spotify+-next <RET>=.
- Play the previous song with =M-x spotify+-prev <RET>=.
