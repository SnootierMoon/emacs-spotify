* Emacs Spotify Plus

Spotify Plus allows you to control Spotify from within Emacs.
This plugin uses the PKCE OAuth2 flow, which provides more security and is built for serverless plugins like these.

For now, this plugin allows you to play the next/previous song, and play/pause on the current device. However, it may soon have features such as displaying, modifying, and searching for data in buffers.
